The farm has a labor force of 3,500 person-days in autumn and winter, and 4,000 person-days in spring and summer. If the labor force is not fully utilized, they can work outside. The wage for hired labor is 2.1 yuan/person-day in spring and summer, and 1.8 yuan/person-day in autumn and winter. The farm grows three crops: soybeans, corn, and wheat, and raises cows and chickens. There is no need for additional investment when planting crops, but for animal farming, it costs 400 yuan per cow and 3 yuan per chicken. When raising cows, 1.5 hectares of land are needed to grow grass for each cow, and it requires 100 person-days of labor in autumn and winter, and 50 person-days in spring and summer. The net income per cow per year is 400 yuan. When raising chickens, no land is needed, but it requires 0.6 person-days of labor in autumn and winter, and 0.3 person-days in spring and summer. The net income per chicken per year is 2 yuan. The farm has a chicken coop that can accommodate up to 3,000 chickens, and a cowshed that can accommodate up to 32 cows. The labor requirements and net income per hectare per year for the three crops are shown in Table 1-9.\n\nTable 1-9\n\\begin{tabular}{l|c|c|c}\n\\hline \\multicolumn{1}{c}{ Crop } & Soybeans & Corn & Wheat \\\\\n\\hline Person-days required in autumn and winter & 20 & 35 & 10 \\\\\nPerson-days required in spring and summer & 50 & 75 & 40 \\\\\nNet income per hectare per year (yuan/hm^2) & 175 & 300 & 120 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\nDetermine the farm's operating plan to maximize net income per year.\n```\nPlease write the corresponding five-element model.
